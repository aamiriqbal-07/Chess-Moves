The Chess Board is a two diamentional matrix with 8 rows and 8 columns and each cell is uniquely indentified by its namewhich consists of 
2 characters. The rows are numbered from '1' through '8' and columns are numbered from 'A' through 'H'. For example A8, B4.

There are in total 6 unique pieces that a user could choose from i.e. "King", "Qween", "Horse", "Pawn", "Bishop", "Rook".

For Input string --- 
    i) The input string should consists of two words only in the format "Word1 Word2" (without quotes).
   ii) Word1 : It should be the name of one of the unique pieces provided above.
  iii) Word2 : It should be the cell or location of that particular piece given in Word1. The positions should be in [column_row] 
               format only, such as A8, B4 etc.
   iv) There are mainly 64 unique cell positions over the chess board and any type of position beyong these may result in an error.
       E.g. C9, 4K, 9C, K4 all are invalid!
    v) Similarly, the names of the pieces should be coreectly spelled (without any case senstivity).
       E.g. Horse, hORse, kING, RoOk the all are valid input for Word1.
       
  
Movement of "King":
    The King could only from its initial position to only one of its valid 8 positions in all the 8 directions respectively.
    Input 1 : King B4: (Here the King has all the options in the 8 diretions).
    Output 1: C5 A3 C3 A5 B3 B5 C4 A4 (all possible moves).
    
    Input 2 : King H8
    Output 2: G7 H7 G8 (However, here only 3 possible moves are present).
    

Movement of "Qween":
    The "Qween" could move to any of the8 directions all any number of cells in the corresponding direction all long as the cells are valid.
    Input 1 : Qween B4 
    Output 1: C5 A3 D6 E7 F8 C3 A5 D2 E1 B3 B5 B2 B6 B1 B7 B8 C4 A4 D4 E4 F4 G4 H4 
    
    Input 2 : Qween H8 (input as one of the 4 corners in the chess board)
    Output 2: G7 F6 E5 D4 C3 B2 A1 H7 H6 H5 H4 H3 H2 H1 G8 F8 E8 D8 C8 B8 A8 
    
    Input 3 : Qween E1 (input as one of the 4 boundaries in the chess board)
    Output 3: F2 G3 H4 D2 C3 B4 A5 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7 E8 F1 D1 G1 C1 H1 B1 A1
    
    
Movement of "Bishop":
    The "Bishop" just like the "Qween" could move all possible number of cells but only in 4 diagonal directions.
    Input 1 : Bishop B4
    Output 1: C5 A3 D6 E7 F8 C3 A5 D2 E1 (Movement in all possible 4 diagonal directions).
    
    Input 1 : Bishop H8
    Output 1: G7 F6 E5 D4 C3 B2 A1 (Here movemnt was restricted to only 1 direction). 
    
    
Movement of "Rook":
    The "Rook" is able to move only in Horizontal and Vertical Directions.
    Input 1 : Rook F5
    Output 1: F4 F6 F3 F7 F2 F8 F1 G5 E5 H5 D5 C5 B5 A5 
    
    
Movement of "Horse":
    The "Horse" can move to any spot from its position (2 step vertical + 1 step horizontal) OR (2 step horizontal + 1 step vertical)
    Input 1 : Horse E3 
    Output 1: G4 G2 C4 C2 F5 D5 F1 D1
    
    
Movement of "Pawn":
    The Pawn generally moves one cell in forward direction (towards opponent side). But it could also move one cell Diagonally if and 
    only if there is an opponent piece to capture. 
    Input 1 : Pawn E4 (Movement without any piece to its diagonal position)
    Output 1: F4
    
    Input 2 : Pawn E4 (Movement with any piece to its diagonal position)
    Output 2: F4 F5 F3 (The opponent chess piece could be either on F5 or F3 or may be on both positions).
